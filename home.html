          <p>My role as an undergraduate researcher was to test the program by creating different structures to simulate and

         The program, developed in C++, is used to render 3D structures as mass-spring objects and simulate forces on it.
          The program then optimizes the mass of the structure by removing springs under the least amount of stress.
          The program halts when the object reaches a certain deflection rate or percentage of original mass remaining.

        The Interactive Development Environment was used to simulate any imported volume under a specified force.
          This volume was the result of a cantilever beam subject to a torsional force on one end.
          The result is a hollowed rectangular prism of springs with a spiraling effect.
          My role was to ensure that the program was able to handle different cases and simulations, making it more
          applicable to different real-world uses.

          Because the program was very computation heavy when importing large objects that would turn into hundreds of thousands of mass-spring
          objects, we wanted to benchmark the program in different configurations to find the fastest configuration of
          memory organization and thread-block use.
          </p>

          <p>
          Using the Nvidia Visual Profiler, we were able to discern which kernels hosted the longest computation times, and needed
          reducing. We found that the function with the highest usage of processing power was a function called
          computeSpringForces( ), which is a necessary step in each timestep of the simulation.

          <p>Due to COVID-19, in March of 2020, students everywhere were forced to disperse across the
            globe and leave their campuses, the Covid Design Challenge was conceived to gain ideas on how to maintain our community through virtual campus
            experiences. The three day design challenge was meant to address challenges to our mental health, motivation,
            concentration and resources as students.</p>

            At the outset, I was inspired by ambient loops that I often listened to that simulated the experience of
            being somewhere I wasn’t. I liked to listen to the ones where I was by the beach, listening to the crashing
            of waves or in a house that was experiencing heavy rain. The goal of these ambient loops is to soothe the
            user as well as provide the user the ability to simulate a space that is conducive to productivity.

            I began by cataloging various soundscapes around campus from my experience. I was able to organize and
            create descriptions of what soundbites would be prevalent in each of the spaces. For example, in one of my
            favorite outdoor study spots on the lawn in front of a popular library, it would be common to hear others
            running on grass, children playing and friends chattering. These soundscapes would help me to understand
            the different atmospheres that could be provided by a physical campus.

            The final design was a web application that was functional and allowed the user to choose from different
            spaces of different categories and listen in on a loop of ambient audio that simulates the atmosphere of
            that space. The application also appealed to those who hold certain spaces very dear to their hearts by
            allowing them to submit feedback for spaces they didn’t feel was quite right as well as the ability to
            create a space with precise soundbites and elements in the looping audio.

          <p>I was brought on to the project to design the website for a local farm-to-table organization that promotes traditional
            medicines. The project would give the organization an online presence allowing it to be more accessible to
            those who wish to contact them or use their services.</p>

          other similar collaborative events that are meant to target students of all disciplines who are interested in

         The design challenge assigned for the semester was a challenge to “design for density” in a world that is
          currently suffering from a pandemic. Our team’s territory was city nightlife, we were challenged to create
          some sort of intervention that completed some goal within this territory. We found through research that
          there is an opportunity to provide the necessary safety measures to optimize customer experience and revenue
          streams at nightlife establishments.

          Research showed us that as the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more regulated nightlife experience, bar owners
          were struggling to pay their employees and make rent. Attendance at bars and nightlife venues was declining
          and constrained. We discovered through interviews that the social landscape of bars has changed completely,
          and that customers were forced to compromise this social aspect in their night time outings.

          We reframed the idea with research and customer interviews in mind. We were able to create and reinforce an
          outdoor solution by implementing a space that brought multiple bars from a local area to New York City open streets.
          The idea was that an outdoor COVID-19 safe environment that attracted customers with a multi-bar experience would
          serve as a substitute for indoor bars and would bring back a bar-like atmosphere without the customers
          compromising their own safety.

         The solution showed BarHub is able to provide consistent experience that is exciting each visit, due to its
          changing bar variety and vibrant, safe  atmosphere. This experience was built with bar owners and staff in
          mind, in order to allow them to both advertise and sell their drinks at a satellite location.

          The city of Newburgh, which lies in the Hudson valley, is currently looking for ways to revitalize local
          culture and celebrate their community. The local Newburgh Free Library offered to collaborate with ideas

          Much of local history is kept in the library and spread through oral history.
          This combination of local culture and oral history led to an intervention that
          resulted in the cone. The cone was constructed after the shape of a classic
          theatre, intending to create a space for book readings and oral history tellings.
          Modularity of the structure was introduced by cutting it into mobile
          pieces in order to extend the function of the structure to more activities.
